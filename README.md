# Road Accident Dashboard - Excel Visualization

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **Road Accident Dashboard** using Microsoft Excel to visualize accident casualty data through interactive and insightful charts. The dashboard provides an easy-to-read summary of key metrics related to road accidents, helping users understand patterns and identify key factors behind accident occurrences.

## Features
### Primary Features
- **Total Casualties Overview**: Displays the **total number of casualties (417,883)** segmented into Fatal, Serious, and Slight casualties with their respective percentages.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Visual breakdown of accident counts across different vehicle types (Cars, Motorcycles, Bicycles, etc.).

### Secondary Features
- **Monthly Trend Analysis**: Comparison of the current year's monthly casualty data with the previous year to identify trends.
- **Casualties by Road Type**: Highlights the road types (Single Carriageway, Dual Carriageway, Motorway, etc.) with the highest number of casualties.
- **Casualties by Road Surface Condition**: Visualizes accidents occurring on Dry, Wet, and Snow/Ice surfaces.
- **Casualties by Location vs. Light Condition**: Provides insights into how accidents vary between Rural vs. Urban areas and during Day vs. Night.

## Design Approach
### Key Design Decisions
- Placed **Total Casualties** at the **top left** to align with the user's natural eye flow.
- Added **slicer panel** at the **bottom right** for easy filtering without distracting the user.
- Kept the design **minimal** while conveying maximum insights.

### Color Palette
Following the **3 Color Theory**:
- **Yellow**: To highlight key figures and attract attention.
- **White**: For text and visual clarity.
- **Black**: Background to maintain contrast and a clean layout.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Slicers
